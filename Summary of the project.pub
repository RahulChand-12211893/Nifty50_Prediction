                                          Summary of the code..

1. Importing Libraries: You start by importing the necessary libraries, including yfinance for fetching               stock data and RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.ensemble for building a machine learning model.

2. Fetching Nifty50 Data:
We use yfinance to fetch historical data for the Nifty50 index.

3. Data Cleaning and Preparation:

  We remove unnecessary columns (Dividends and Stock Splits).
  We create a target variable Tomorrow which is the closing price of the next day.
  We create a binary target variable Target based on whether the price will go up or down.


4. Machine Learning Model:
We use a Random Forest Classifier with specific hyperparameters (e.g., n_estimators, min_samples_split) for the initial model.



5. Training and Evaluation:
train the model on a subset of the data and evaluate its performance using precision score.


6. Backtesting:
defining functions for making predictions and backtesting them over different time periods.


7. Feature Engineering:
You create new predictors based on rolling averages and trends over different time horizons.


8. Data Cleaning (Again):
You remove rows with missing values.


9. Model Updating:
Update the model with different hyperparameters.


10. Prediction Probability and Thresholding:
Using the predicted probabilities to make more confident predictions.


11. Backtesting with Updated Model:
We are now runing backtests with the updated model.


12. Final Evaluation:
Now evaluating the final model's performance.
